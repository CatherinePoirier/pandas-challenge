# pandas-challenge

The PyCitySchools Challenge comprised of Disrict School Data about the schools 
and student math and reading scores. The analysis envolved looking breaking 
information into Four Areas
1) District Analysis
2)School Analysis
3)Grade Analysis
3)Scores Analysis

Conclusions

1) District Analysis
This School District has:
Total Schools: 15
Total Students: 39170
Average Math Score: 78.985371
Average Reading Score: 81.87784
% Passed Math: 74.980853
% Passed Reading: 85.805463
Total Budget: 24649428
% Overall Passing: 65.172326

School Analysis
There is a range number of students attending schools from only 427 student to as many as 4976.
There are both Charter and District Schools. The total school Budget varies from $248,087.00 to $3,124,928.00.
The % of Students Passing both Math and Reading varies greatly across schools with as few as 53.204476 students in one school
and as as many 91.334769. The budget per student, per school aren't as pronounced with the lowest being 
$578.00 per student and them most being $655.00 per student.

The top 5 performing schools are all Charter schools and have varying number of student with as few as 962 student and as many as 2283.
All top performing schools have more than 90% of students passing both math and reading. Their math scores are better than their reading
scores with 93% or more student passing Math. The % passing reading are lower and are all around 83%.

The bottom 5 performing schools are all district schools with no charter school in this category. The student population of these 
school are much larger than the top performing schools with a range of 2917 ato 4761 students. All bottom performin schools have 
from 80% to 81% passing reading tbut hey only have between 65% and 67% passing Math. Unfortunately the % of students in these
schools passing both math and reading is around 53% for all schools. The budget for each student is between $639 and $655.

The Math and REading Scores per Grade
There aren't any major difference around math scores for each school across grades. Most scores for schools are within 1% across 
each grades, with a few up to 2%.

Scores by School Spending per student do not necessarily transfer to higher reading and Math scores. For this district the 
schools with the highest budget per student have lower scores across all catergories than the schools spedning the least per student.

Scores by School Size also have lower scores in every category than schools with smaller size.
Lastly Charter Schools significanlty out performed District non charter schools in every category. The % Overall Passing both reading and Mat in 
Charter schools being >90% and the district schools with only 53.67% passing.

In conclusion, the district should consider lowering the School size of district scholls and adopt the model of charter schools
if they would like more student to pass both reading and math.
